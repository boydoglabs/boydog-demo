BoyDog is a framework for building ultra-fast, real-time collaborative web applications. BoyDog uses ShareDB's OT (operational transformation) to keep data consistent even if multiple users are editing the same text at the same time.
You can use this repository as your starting boilerplate for your real-time collaborative projects.
